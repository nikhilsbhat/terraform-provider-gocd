# gocd_pipeline_group (Resource)
Creates pipeline group in GoCD with all below passed parameters by interacting with GoCD cluster profile [api](https://api.gocd.org/current/#create-a-pipeline-group).

## Example Usage
```terraform
resource "gocd_pipeline_group" "sample_group_2" {
  name      = "sample-group-2"
  pipelines = ["helm-images", "helm-drift"]
  authorization {
    view {
      users = ["nikhil"]
      roles = ["sample"]
    }
    operate {
      users = ["nikhil"]
      roles = ["sample"]
    }
    admins {
      users = ["nikhil"]
      roles = ["sample"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Importing the existing GoCD pipeline groups to Terraform State

resource "gocd_pipeline_group" "sample_group" {
    name = "sample-group"
}
```

```shell
# Once the above code is added, the resource can be imported by running the below command.
